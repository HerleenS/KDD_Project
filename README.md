**Introduction to the Dataset:**

We are working on retail data taken from Kaggle. The dataset contains records of 2 years data collected from 45 different Walmart stores for time period 5/2/2010 to 1/11/2012. We are working with 4 datasets train,features,stores and test(for testing our models). 

**Train dataset contains the following predictors:**

Store - the store number</br>
Dept - the department number</br>
Date - the week</br>
IsHoliday - whether the week is a special holiday week</br>
Weekly_Sales -  sales for the given department in the given store

**Features dataset contains the following predictors:**

Store - the store number</br>
Date - the week</br>
Temperature - average temperature in the region</br>
Fuel_Price - cost of fuel in the region</br>
MarkDown1-5 - anonymized data related to promotional markdowns that Walmart is running. MarkDown data is only available after Nov 2011, and is not available for all stores all the time. Missing values are marked as NA.</br>
CPI - the consumer price index</br>
Unemployment - the unemployment rate</br>
IsHoliday - whether the week is a special holiday week

**Stores dataset contains the following predictors:**

Store - the store number</br>
Size-size of store</br>
Type-type of store

**Goal/Target variable:**

Our aim is to predict the Weekly Sales. Therefore, Weekly_Sales is our target variable on which we will test the effects of other predictors.

**Defining Cross-Industry Standard Process For Data Mining:**

According to the Cross-Industry Standard Process For Data Mining, a project life cycle consist of six phases. The phase sequence is adaptive. That is, the next phase in the sequence often depends on the outcome associated with the previous phase.
The six phases are:</br>

**1.Business/Research Understanding Phase**
First, clearly define the project objectives and requirements in terms of the business or research unit as a whole and then translate these goals and restrictions into the formulation of a data mining problem definition.
Finally, prepare a preliminary strategy for achieving these objectives.

**2.Data Understanding Phase**
The first step is to collect the data and then use exploratory data analysis to familiarize ourselves with the data and discover initial insights. The next step is to evaluate the quality of the data and if required select the interesting subsets that may contain actionable patterns.

**3.Data Preparation Phase**
This is a  labor-intensive phase that covers all aspects of preparing the final data set, which shall be used for subsequent phases, from the initial, raw, dirty data. Here we select the cases and variables we want to analyze, and that is appropriate for our analysis.We perform transformations on certain variables if needed. The goal is to clean the raw data so that it is ready for the modeling tools.

**4.Modeling Phase**
In this phase, we select and apply one or more modeling techniques on our dataset. The model is often calibrated to optimize results.If necessary, additional data preparation may be required for supporting a particular technique

**5.Evaluation Phase**
In this phase, we evaluate one or more generated models for effectiveness. We determine whether defined objectives are achieved using the models. Finally, we come to a decision regarding the use of data mining results.

**6.Deployment Phase**
Model creation does not signify the completion of the project. After model creation, we have to deploy our model so that one can make use of it. The deployment can be carried in multiple ways. 
For example, a simple deployment can be like generate a report or it can be more complex deployment like implement a parallel data mining process in some another domain.
